# About Sel-out
### Personal opinion
---
Using Internal AA buffer with sprites only is better when using sprite in magnify pixel situation. When Sel-out method encounter magnify pixel situation, those black outline section looks like noise or bad AA. Additionally, If pixel art illustration using default or light influenced outline AA is better.
